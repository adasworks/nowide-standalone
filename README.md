nowide-standalone
=================

The original `nowide` repo can be found at [github/artyom-beilis/nowide](https://github.com/artyom-beilis/nowide), it depends on the boost libraries and has no CMake config-module support.
The author has released a no-boost, standalone release: http://cppcms.com/files/nowide/nowide_standalone.zip. This for builds upon that release (released around 2015-Sep-24).

These are my changes over the `nowide_standalone` release:

- a few commits made to the original repo were applied here (for details see commit history)
- CMake improvements including config-module support
